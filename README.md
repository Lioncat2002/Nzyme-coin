# Nzyme-coins
 A simple crypto currency I am trying to make in Type Script
 
I am just learning making block chains and crypto currencies</br>

## How to run:

- Have `node>=12` installed(This repository has been tested with `node 16` btw)
- run `npm install` inside the project directory
- run `ts-node index.ts` to start an instance of the block-chain

### Now What?

I need some ideas about improvements/ new ideas that I can implement into this
