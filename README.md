# Nzyme-coins
 A simple crypto currency I am trying to make in Type Script
 
## This is based on [Fireship's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF7dkrce-mQ)

I am just learning making block chains and crypto currencies</br>
~~_Also to flex on my friends_~~


## How to run:

- Have `node>=12` installed(This repository has been tested with `node 16` btw)
- run `npm install` inside the project directory
- run `ts-node index.ts` to start an instance of the block-chain

### Now What?

I need some ideas about improvements/ new ideas that I can implement into this
